This is a blog created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can write new posts in Markdown format and save them in the `posts` directory. They will be included in the list of posts in the home page, with a link to the posts page. You don't have to write any code to add a new blog post.


## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js blog is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

However, it's possible to deploy this to any static hosting provider.
